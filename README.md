# Example Target

This is an example of a Pico target. It's a simple docker-compose project that launches a hello world container.

## Why are there so many empty commits?

Pushing a commit triggers Pico to execute the target's command, defined [here](https://github.com/picostack/pico-config-hello/blob/master/main.js#L4). I do this to smoke test Pico sometimes.
